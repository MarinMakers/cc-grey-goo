# cc-grey-goo
An apocalyptic ComputerCraft script based off [the Grey Goo scenario](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_goo).

The idea is that one mining turtle should be self sufficient, mine in a straight plane going either x+z or y+z, and acquire all of the resources to build another mining turtle.
Once the turtle has enough materials, it will craft a new turtle, twist them left or right, and execute this script.
